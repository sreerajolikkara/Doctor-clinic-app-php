DOC is an online application that can be used by clinics who preffer network based data storage and retrieval rather than using a software with seperate installation in each system. DOC is preffered over other softwares, reason being its easy interface with very less complexities and faster data retrieval.

Used by:
doctors
receptionists
admin(to authenticate the data inserted)

The details of the patient can be searched using their patient id or mobile number.The details include name, age, mobile number, last arrival date etc.
Doctors can access all the details of the patient including their last visit and all medication details. It is the duty of the software to find the present date and check with the last visited date and charge the patient fees only if last visit date is more than 7 days from the present date.

This is an online application that runs under a local server (here WAMP) and phpmyadmin database. Can be editted in any form using simple alteration in codes.
Database name can be found within the code and requires a wamp server and suitable folder name change for the proper exution of application.
